- [x] Private methods clearly marked
- [x] Public API documented with XML comments
- [x] Consistent naming conventions
- [x] Proper namespace usage

### Maintainability
- [x] Easy to locate specific functionality
- [x] Easy to add new dice effects
- [x] Easy to add new multiplier types
- [x] Easy to modify hand rules
- [x] Easy to change view creation logic

## âœ… Documentation

- [x] DICE_MECHANICS_IMPLEMENTATION.md updated
- [x] REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md created
- [x] REFACTORING_VERIFICATION.md created
- [x] All new classes have XML comments
- [x] Complex methods documented
- [x] Architecture explained

## âœ… Testing Readiness

### Unit Testable Components
- [x] HandManager - pure C# logic, no Unity dependencies
- [x] DiceMultiplierCalculator - pure C# logic
- [x] DiceEffectHandler - minimal Unity dependencies (Random)
- [x] DiceViewFactory - Unity-dependent but mockable

### Integration Points
- [x] BattleController â†’ HandManager (clear interface)
- [x] BattleController â†’ DiceEffectHandler (clear interface)
- [x] BattleController â†’ DiceMultiplierCalculator (clear interface)
- [x] BattleController â†’ DiceViewFactory (clear interface)
- [x] All components â†’ CooldownSystem (unchanged)

## ðŸ“Š Metrics Summary
